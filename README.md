# quintessence

Requires PHP 5.4 or higher

My first self-written "framework" for skill level-up and also learning to use git

Not documented, not stable, not even alpha. Keeping coding.

I'll be extremely thankful If you tell me about issues and ways to make it better or even how things shall not be done.


Finally in pre-alpha. You may clone repository, import database dump, configure connection to it in /config/main.php and configure your website document_root to /frontend/ (yep, tis similar to yii).


login page at
site.com/login/

admin page at
site.com/praefect/

login and pass are "admin".

Admin-panel is empty(only layout for future). I don't know how to architect it correctly.

As I already said I'll be thankful to u if you report issues and give advices.
