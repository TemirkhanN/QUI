v0.2

Non-cat
--From now everything from my project is available in repository.
--Added FRONTEND_DIR const and placed it everywhere in backend
--Moved pages and layouts to views folder
--Commented core classes
--Changed dependencies loading system - added autoloader and removed dependencies.php totally
--Changed namespaces that point on classes in folders that have dashes in names. for example
---- we had /backend/core/file-worker/File.php   with namespace /app/core/file/worker/File
---- now it looks like /app/core/file_worker/File .
---- that is because i don't have another way to autoload classes in dash separate folders(except renaming folders)
App
