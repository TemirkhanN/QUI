v0.1


App
--Renamed checkCacheActual to cacheExpires
--Removed debugging tmp information from showErrors()
--Added validation to run(). It hasn't been checking if rules and request aren't empty
--Changed plugin include order. Now  App class calls PluginName::init() automatically if it exists. If so plugin shall implement app\core\base\Plugin
--Plugin include also checks if there is plugin-dependencies in plugin folder. If it is not It tries to require single plugin file from same folder
--fonts in plugin-dependencies shall be set with extension for some flexibility
--Added toCamelCase() static function.
--Added checking if controller already loaded by somewhere else before.(for example, rating plugin has controller in dependencies)
--Changed runController() method. Now it's possible to pass from route controller name that lay in subdirectories via separating path with symbol"-" 'content-programming-php'(where ph is controller name fully PhpController)
--copyFileToFolder() has been moved to file-worker/File class
--debugTimeTrack renamed to debugTrack. debugShowTime track also renamed to debugShowTrack
--Part of logic has been moved from loadPlugin to loadPluginDependencies()
--loadPlugin now checks if plugin has already been included

(!!!) for example app\plugins\password-compat\PasswordCompat it should be parsed as app\plugins\password\compat\PasswordCompat
Controller
--Added checking duplicate files including from plugins(tis useful if plugins use similar dependencies)
--Changed loadFileToTemplateDir(). Now it puts fonts into css/fonts/ .
--Added setCustomTemplate(true|false) and isCustomTemplate(). If tis set to custom it will echo raw content otherwise template <body>(.*)</body> markup will be used.
(!!!)Note that echo shall be set at template. i.e.  if($this->isCustomTemplate()){$this->content();} else{ <lotsoftags...... $this->content(); .....lotsoftags>}
--Changed File::copyFileToFolder() in registerCss,js and loadFileToTemplateDir() methods. Now they pass only two args(from, to) insted of three
--Changed renderPage method. Previously it replaced all matches of controller word so you're not be able to set controller name like this FooControllerBarController
controller pages folder name previously should be named as fooBar. now it fixed and shall be names as foo-bar
